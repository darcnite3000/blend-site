# we’re a team of Accident & Health and Niche Personal Lines insurance experts

### So, what does Blend do?

We are Accident & Health and Niche Personal Lines underwriters and product experts.
Our core specialty is the design and delivery of optimised solutions tailored for, and targeted at, groups of businesses and/or individuals.
That could be via:

* associations, affinity groups and schemes. We seek to deliver value to their members or member company employees; or
* partnerships with companies who wish to offer insurance to their customers

### What do you mean by design and delivery?

We have developed a suite of benefits that we tailor to each different groups characteristics and needs.
We understand the importance of being a value generator, we are inspired by technology and efficiency.
Our team is structured for execution, employing program management principles which enable us to work with our partners to deliver a seamless implementation, establish transaction efficiency and optimise to agreed objectives.
To achieve that it’s important to be thoughtful, we'd work with you to study the group opportunity, provide and our expert view on whether it is something worth focusing on because we often see what on face value look to be great ideas but in reality, are not commercially viable for all involved.

### Great, but what is Blend’s differentiation?

As a start-up business we are unencumbered which means we are nimble and have a dedicated and focused team.
We'll be maximising technology which means we can deliver value with efficiencies not possible with a traditional program which in turn makes us more competitive.
But the most important thing is that we are passionately customer centric and on a mission to:

* simplify policy language and claim experience;
* achieve alignment of product to need and value for customer;
* improve and streamline workflows; and
* leverage technology to create a connection for customers

We've developed a diagnostic approach in support of maximising delivery efficiency.

First, we complete an assessment of potential partnerships and the customer opportunity, our diagnostics provide an understanding of a groups characterises to confirm an insurance need and a projection for the opportunity.
This is then followed by recommendations in relation to:

* achieving product fit
* sales & service processes
* strategic marketing
* operational processes
* technology requirements
