# journey

Where an employee is excluded from journey cover under their state’s Workers Compensation system, Journey cover provides a lump sum benefit in the event of death or permanent disability, or weekly benefits in the event of accidental injury sustained while travelling to and from work.

Our Journey policy protects employees in transit to and from their place of work if Workers’ Compensation doesn’t provide cover. Choose between capital benefits cover or weekly benefits for injury or illness.
