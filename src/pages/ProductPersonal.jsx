          Our Individual Personal Accident product covers a variety of
          occupations. The product provides lump sum benefits due to death or
          permanent disability from accidental injury and weekly benefits for
          temporary disablement due to accidental, injury or sickness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if you already hold some type of insurance, your existing
          policies may not cover you for serious accidents that can prevent you
          from continuing your busy lifestyle or returning to work. A serious
          injury can have a huge impact on you and your family due to medical
          expenses, reduced income, and your inability to return to normal
          duties at work.

          Blend Personal Accident Insurance provides a lump sum payout on
          eligible claims regardless of whether you return to work or not. This
          cover provides certainty in what is often a very uncertain and
          unsettling time.
