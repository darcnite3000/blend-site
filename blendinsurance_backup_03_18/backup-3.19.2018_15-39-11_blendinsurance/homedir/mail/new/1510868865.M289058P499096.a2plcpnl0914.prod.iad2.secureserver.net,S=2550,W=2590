An update to WordPress 4.7.7 (security release) is now available for the WordPress installations you are managing using Installatron. The following can be updated:

- http://blendinsurancesolutions.com.au


The changes for this version are:

WordPress 4.7.7 is now available. This is a security release for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.

WordPress versions 4.8.2 and earlier are affected by an issue where $wpdb-&gt;prepare() can create unexpected and unsafe queries leading to potential SQL injection (SQLi). WordPress core is not directly vulnerable to this issue, but we've added hardening to prevent plugins and themes from accidentally causing a vulnerability. Reported by Anthony Ferrara.

This release includes a change in behaviour for the esc_sql() function. Most developers will not be affected by this change, you can read more details in the developer note on the website.

Login to your web hosting control panel and navigate to the Installatron tool to update your installed applications.

End of report.
