* A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the oEmbed discovery. Reported by xknown of the WordPress Security Team.
* A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the visual editor. Reported by Rodolfo Assis (@brutelogic) of Sucuri Security.
* A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in the file unzipping code. Reported by Alex Chapman (noxrnet).
* A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the plugin editor. Reported by 陈瑞琦 (Chen Ruiqi).
* An open redirect was discovered on the user and term edit screens. Reported by Yasin Soliman (ysx).
* A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in the customizer. Reported by Weston Ruter of the WordPress Security Team.
* A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in template names. Reported by Luka (sikic).
* A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the link modal. Reported by Anas Roubi (qasuar).

In addition to the security issues above, WordPress 4.8.2 contains 6 maintenance fixes to the 4.8 release series.
