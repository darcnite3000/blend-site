- http://blendinsurancesolutions.com.au


The changes for this version are:

WordPress 4.9.2 is a security and maintenance release for all versions since WordPress 3.7ï»¿. We strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.

An XSS vulnerability was discovered in the Flash fallback files in MediaElement, a library that is included with WordPress. Because the Flash files are no longer needed for most use cases, they have been removed from WordPress.

Highlights
* JavaScript errors that prevented saving posts in Firefox have been fixed.
* The previous taxonomy-agnostic behavior of get_category_link() and category_description() was restored.
* Switching themes will now attempt to restore previous widget assignments, even when there are no sidebars to map.

Login to your web hosting control panel and navigate to the Installatron tool to update your installed applications.

End of report.
