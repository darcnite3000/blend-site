# individual personal accident

Our Individual Personal Accident product covers a variety of occupations. The product provides lump sum benefits due to death or permanent disability from accidental injury and weekly benefits for temporary disablement due to accidental, injury or sickness.

Even if you already hold some type of insurance, your existing policies may not cover you for serious accidents that can prevent you from continuing your busy lifestyle or returning to work. A serious injury can have a huge impact on you and your family due to medical expenses, reduced income, and your inability to return to normal duties at work.

Blend Personal Accident Insurance provides a lump sum payout on eligible claims regardless of whether you return to work or not. This cover provides certainty in what is often a very uncertain and unsettling time.
