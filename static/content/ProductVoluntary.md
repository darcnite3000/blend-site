Volunteers have an important role and are not eligible for Workers Compensation. Our product provides protection against financial loss if an injury occurs whilst conducting voluntary work.

While an unpaid worker is not covered by workers compensation, they still face the risk of injury while performing their duties. This could prevent them from participating in their usual paid employment and leave them susceptible to substantial expenses. A comprehensive voluntary workers policy will ensure associations meet their duty of care obligations to this valuable resource.
